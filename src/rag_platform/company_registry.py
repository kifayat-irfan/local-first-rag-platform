"""
Central registry of all onboarded companies, backed by a single JSON file
(data/registry.json).

Design decision — JSON, not SQLite: at the scale this platform targets
(tens of companies, not thousands), a single JSON file is simpler to
inspect, diff in git, and back up than a database file, and avoids adding
a SQLite dependency + migration story for what's fundamentally a small,
infrequently-written config table. If company count grows into the
thousands or writes become highly concurrent, SQLite (or a real DB) is the
right next step — the CompanyRegistry interface below is narrow enough
that swapping the storage backend wouldn't touch calling code.
