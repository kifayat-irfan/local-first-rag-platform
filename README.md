A local-first, offline-capable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform
for company engineering documentation. Ingests PDFs, isolates data per
company, and answers questions with page-accurate citations — no cloud APIs
required.

**[Live demo](#) · [Screenshots below](#screenshots) · Built with pypdf, pdfplumber, BGE embeddings, ChromaDB, BM25, cross-encoder reranking, Ollama, and Streamlit**

**Isolation guarantee:** every company gets its own `data/companies/{id}/`
directory tree — its own raw PDFs, manifest, checkpoint, and **separate
ChromaDB instance** (not a shared DB with a metadata filter). A bug in a
query's filter can't leak another company's data, because there's no shared
database to leak from.

## Setup

```bash
cd Enterprise_RAG_Platform
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Or with the Makefile: `make install-dev`.

For answer generation you'll also need [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running
locally with a model pulled:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```
Retrieval-only usage (`--no-llm` on `query_company.py`) doesn't need Ollama.

## Onboarding a New Company (3 steps)

**1. Register the company** — creates its isolated data directories:
```bash
python scripts/manage_companies.py add company_a --name "Acme Corp"
```

**2. Create its config**, copying the template and filling in `company.id`:
```bash
cp configs/template.yaml configs/company_a.yaml
# edit configs/company_a.yaml: set company.id: company_a, company.name, etc.
```

**3. Drop PDFs into its raw_pdfs directory and ingest:**
```bash
cp your_docs/*.pdf data/companies/company_a/raw_pdfs/
python scripts/ingest_company_pdfs.py --company company_a
```

## Querying a Company

```bash
# Full QA with LLM-generated answer + citations
python scripts/query_company.py --company company_a --query "What is the deployment process?"

# Retrieval only — see the ranked chunks without generating an answer
python scripts/query_company.py --company company_a --query "rollback steps" --no-llm --top-k 5
```

## CLI Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/ingest_company_pdfs.py --company ID` | Extract, chunk, embed, index a company's PDFs. Resumable. |
| `scripts/query_company.py --company ID --query "..."` | Query a company's indexed corpus. `--no-llm` for retrieval only. |
| `scripts/manage_companies.py list` | Show all registered companies with stats. |
| `scripts/manage_companies.py add ID --name "Name"` | Register a new company, create its data directories. |
| `scripts/manage_companies.py info ID` | Show detailed stats for one company. |
| `scripts/manage_companies.py remove ID [--delete-data]` | Unregister; optionally delete its data too. |
| `scripts/manage_companies.py update ID` | Refresh registry stats from the manifest on disk. |
| `scripts/check_manifest.py --company ID` | Audit manifest vs disk; exits non-zero on drift (CI-friendly). |
| `scripts/reset_data.py --company ID [--yes]` | Wipe derived state (clean/, manifest, checkpoint, vector store). Raw PDFs untouched. |

Makefile shortcuts: `make ingest COMPANY=company_a`, `make query COMPANY=company_a QUERY="..."`, `make companies`, `make check-manifest COMPANY=company_a`, `make reset COMPANY=company_a`.

## Scraping a Documentation Website into PDFs

If a company's docs live on a website rather than as downloadable PDFs,
`scripts/scrape_docs_to_pdf.py` crawls it and saves every page as a PDF —
the automated equivalent of visiting each page and doing Ctrl+P.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-scraping.txt
playwright install chromium

python scripts/scrape_docs_to_pdf.py \
    --url https://example.com/docs \
    --prefix /docs \
    --out data/companies/example/raw_pdfs \
    --max-pages 200
```

Uses a real headless browser (Playwright), not a plain HTTP request, for
both discovering links and exporting PDFs — most modern documentation
sites (Next.js, Docusaurus, Mintlify, VitePress) render their navigation
with client-side JavaScript, which a plain GET request never sees. Stays
within the given domain + path prefix, and crawls with bounded concurrency.
Only use this on sites you own or have explicit permission to scrape.

Kept as a separate optional dependency (`requirements-scraping.txt`) since
Playwright + a bundled Chromium binary (~150–300MB) is only needed for this
one-off step, not for running the RAG platform itself.

## Streamlit UI

A full chat-style UI is included (`streamlit_app.py`) — company switcher, PDF
upload with in-browser ingestion, retrieval + reranked citations, optional
LLM-generated answers, persistent chat history, cross-company comparison,
in-memory caching, and voice input.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501`. Three tabs once a company is selected:

- **💬 Chat** — ask questions, optionally record audio instead of typing
  (needs a free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) — see below).
  Retrieval + citations work with no setup; check "Generate LLM answer" to
  also generate a synthesized response. Two LLM modes: **🔒 Local** (Ollama,
  fully offline) or **🌐 Public** (Groq's hosted LLM, free tier — works even
  without a local Ollama, e.g. on a deployed demo). Switch per-question.
- **🔍 Compare Companies** — ask the same question across 2+ companies at
  once, answers shown side by side. Useful for "how does GitLab's policy on
  X differ from Basecamp's?" style questions.
- **📜 History** — every question you've asked (per company) is saved to a
  local SQLite database automatically. Search, star, or delete past
  conversations.

**Caching:** identical (company, question, top_k, LLM-on/off) combinations
are served from an in-memory cache (`cachetools.TTLCache`, 1 hour TTL by
default) instead of re-running embedding + retrieval + reranking. This is a
process-local cache, not Redis — see the design decisions section below for
why that's the right call at this scale.

**Voice input** is the one feature that isn't fully local: it calls Groq's
hosted Whisper API (free tier) to transcribe recorded audio to text. Text
queries, retrieval, and LLM generation (via Ollama) all remain local; only
the optional microphone button leaves the machine, and only when you use it.
Set `GROQ_API_KEY` (or `RAG_GROQ_API_KEY`) in your environment or `.env` to
enable it — without a key, everything else works exactly the same, the mic
button just shows a clear error if used.

### Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push this repo to GitHub (see `.gitignore` — company data and `.env`
   are excluded by default, so you're not committing indexed PDFs).
2. If you want the hosted demo to show real results out of the box, force-add
   one small pre-ingested company so visitors see something immediately:
   ```bash
   git add -f data/companies/demo_co/ configs/demo_co.yaml
   ```
3. On [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), point a new app at
   this repo, main branch, `streamlit_app.py` as the entry point.
4. **Important:** the hosted app has no access to your local Ollama —
   "localhost:11434" only means something on your own machine. Two options:
   - Leave "Generate LLM answer" unchecked by default on the hosted demo.
     Retrieval + reranking + citations alone are a complete, honest showcase
     of the pipeline and need nothing extra to run.
   - Point the sidebar's Ollama URL field at a publicly reachable Ollama
     instance (e.g. tunneled via `ngrok http 11434` while your machine is
     on) if you want live LLM answers during a demo session.
5. Streamlit Cloud's filesystem is **ephemeral** — anything ingested through
   the hosted UI (new companies, uploaded PDFs) is lost on redeploy/restart.
   That's expected for a live demo; treat step 2's pre-ingested company as
   the persistent "always works" showcase, and uploads as a "try it live"
   feature that resets periodically.
6. For voice input on the hosted demo, add `GROQ_API_KEY` under the app's
   **Secrets** in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard (Settings → Secrets) —
   never commit a real key to the repo.

### Deploying with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts both the app (`localhost:8501`) and an Ollama instance in the
same Compose stack — `docker compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
to pull a model into the containerized Ollama the first time. Company data
persists in a named Docker volume (`rag_data`) across container restarts.
If you'd rather use an Ollama already running on your host instead of the
one in Compose, delete the `ollama` service from `docker-compose.yml` and
point `RAG_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` at `http://host.docker.internal:11434` (Mac/
Windows) or your host's LAN IP (Linux).

## Running Tests

```bash
make test
# or directly:
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -v
```

30 tests across 5 files, all passing:
- `test_pdf_extractor.py` — heading/code-block detection, page markers, scanned-PDF flagging
- `test_company_registry.py` — add/list/info/remove/duplicate/not-found
- `test_config_loader.py` — YAML template inheritance, validation errors, tenant isolation
- `test_integration.py` — full pipeline (extract → chunk → index → retrieve) against a synthetic reportlab-generated PDF, plus scanned-PDF skip behavior
- `test_chat_history_and_cache.py` — chat history isolation/search/star/delete, cache hit/miss behavior

Integration and unit tests use a deterministic fake embedder instead of
downloading the real BGE model, so the suite runs fully offline and in
under 2 seconds. To smoke-test with the real model, run
`scripts/ingest_company_pdfs.py` against a real company directly (first run
downloads ~130MB from Hugging Face).

## Design Decisions

1. **PDF library:** pypdf primary (fast, handles most digitally-authored
   PDFs), pdfplumber fallback — used both when pypdf's output looks sparse
   AND as the only source of per-character font metadata, which is what
   heading/code-block detection actually needs.
2. **Per-company ChromaDB, not shared + filter:** stronger isolation
   guarantee — see Architecture above.
3. **Process pool for PDF extraction:** text extraction is CPU-bound;
   `ProcessPoolExecutor` sidesteps the GIL, unlike a thread pool.
4. **Config inheritance:** company YAMLs deep-merge onto `template.yaml` —
   only override what differs; platform-wide defaults change in one place.
5. **Registry storage:** single `registry.json`, not SQLite — simpler to
   inspect/diff/back up at the scale (tens of companies) this targets.
6. **Page numbers:** inline `<!-- page:N -->` markers in the extracted
   markdown, not a side-channel metadata list — survives the chunker's
   paragraph merging/splitting, which a separate index-aligned list wouldn't.
7. **Chunking for technical docs:** fenced code blocks are treated as
   atomic units, never split mid-line, and never blended into the
   overlap carried between chunks (see the docstring on
   `chunker.py::_merge_with_overlap` for the specific bug this avoids).
8. **Cache: in-memory (cachetools), not Redis:** at single-user/portfolio
   scale, an external cache server is operational overhead with no payoff —
   a process-local `TTLCache` gives the same hit/miss/expiry behavior with
   zero extra infrastructure. Redis becomes the right call once multiple
   app instances need to share one cache, not before.
9. **Chat history: one shared SQLite DB, not per-company:** every row is
   tagged with `company_id`, but there's a single `data/chat_history.sqlite3`
   rather than one DB per tenant. Chat history is the user's own question
   log, not another tenant's source documents — it doesn't need the hard
   isolation vector stores need, and a single DB makes "show everything
   I've asked" and cross-company comparison a plain filtered query instead
   of a fan-out across N databases.
10. **Voice input is the one non-local step, by design:** Whisper models are
    heavy enough that local CPU transcription is slow, so voice input calls
    Groq's hosted Whisper API (free tier) instead. Every other step —
    embeddings, retrieval, reranking, LLM generation — stays fully local;
    voice is opt-in per question and only runs when you click the mic.

## Troubleshooting

**"HTTP 403" / "couldn't connect to huggingface.co" during ingestion**
The embedding model downloads from Hugging Face on first use. Check your
network connection and that huggingface.co isn't blocked by a firewall/proxy.
Subsequent runs use the local cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`) and don't need
network access.

**A PDF is flagged as scanned but it has real text**
The scanned-detection heuristic (>50% of pages under 20 extracted
characters) is deliberately conservative. If a real PDF trips it, check
`scripts/check_manifest.py --company ID` — it will show `[SCANNED]` for
that file. Multi-column layouts or unusual fonts can occasionally cause
false positives; there's no OCR fallback by design, so such a PDF should be
re-exported or manually converted before ingesting.

**Ollama connection refused**
`query_company.py` (without `--no-llm`) needs a local Ollama server.
Start it with `ollama serve` and confirm the model is pulled:
`ollama pull llama3.1:8b`.

**Re-running ingestion doesn't pick up a PDF I edited**
Confirm the file's actual bytes changed (SHA-256-based dedup, not
mtime-based) — re-saving without changing content won't trigger
reprocessing. `scripts/check_manifest.py --company ID` shows
`HASH_MISMATCH` for files that will be reprocessed on the next run.

**A company's data directory got corrupted / I want to start over**
`scripts/reset_data.py --company ID` wipes derived state (manifest, clean
files, checkpoint, vector store) without touching `raw_pdfs/` — re-run
`ingest_company_pdfs.py` afterward to rebuild everything from the source PDFs.
